## My process

I started with structuring the HTML document, and describing each element with a class attribute. Then I proceeded to create custom CSS properties, and creating a flexbox layout for the component. Then, I styled all the elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I practiced using flexbox and learned more about how it works. I also learned to use custom css properties, @media queries, and I also tried resolution switching for the product image for the first time (which I don't know if I have done correctly). I also learned a little bit of styling text on the page.

### Continued development

I still feel I need to better understand how the flexbox works. I am not certain about my resolution switching solution, and also I am wondering about the structure of the documents - are they readable enough, so that if I worked in a team other people would know what is going on inside? 

### Useful resources

- [Responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - This helped me to switch the images depending on screen size.
